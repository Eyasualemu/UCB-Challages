# Analyze the loan to determine the investment evaluation.

# Using more detailed data on one of these loans, follow these steps to calculate a Present Value, or a "fair price" for what this loan would be worth.

# 1. Use get() on the dictionary of additional information to extract the **Future Value** and **Remaining Months** on the loan.
#     a. Save these values as variables called `future_value` and `remaining_months`.
#     b. Print each variable.

# #     @NOTE:
# #     **Future Value**: The amount of money the borrower has to pay back upon maturity of the loan (a.k.a. "Face Value")
# #     **Remaining Months**: The remaining maturity (in months) before the loan needs to be fully repaid.

# # 2. Use the formula for Present Value to calculate a "fair value" of the loan. Use a minimum required return of 20% as the discount rate.
# # 3. Write a conditional statement (an if-else statement) to decide if the present value represents the loan's fair value.
# #     a. If the present value of the loan is greater than or equal to the cost, then print a message that says the loan is worth at least the cost to buy it.
# #     b. Else, the present value of the loan is less than the loan cost, then print a message that says that the loan is too expensive and not worth the price.
