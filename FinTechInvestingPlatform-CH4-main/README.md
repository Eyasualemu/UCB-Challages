Using the starter code file and the provided CSV files, complete the following steps.

1. Import the required libraries and dependencies. 

2. Set paths to the CSV files by creating a `path` object for each CSV file path. Each CSV file contains a stock's closing price and the date of the closing price.
    
3. Use the Pandas `pct_change` function together with `dropna` to create the daily returns DataFrame.

10. Verify the portfolio diversity by calculating the beta and comparing to S&P 500
    
Based on the calculation BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC seem more sensitive to movements in the S&P 500. If you see the beta mean for BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC it's way higher than TIGER GLOBAL MANAGEMENT LLC
BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC beta mean = 0.2214986101354593

TIGER GLOBAL MANAGEMENT LLC beta mean = 0.03093001487238774

Since TIGER GLOBAL MANAGEMENT LLC is less sensitive to movements in the S&P 500 i recommend for inclusion in my firmâ€™s suite of fund offerings
