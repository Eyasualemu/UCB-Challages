1. Import the required libraries and dependencies. 

2. Set paths to the CSV files by creating a `path` object for each CSV file path. Each CSV file contains a stock's closing price and the date of the closing price.
    
3. Read the data from each CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame. Be sure to do the following:
