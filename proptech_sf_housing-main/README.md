Using the starter code file and the provided CSV files, complete the following steps.

1.	Calculate and Plot the Housing Units per Year
numerical and visual aggregation to calculate the number of housing units per year, and then visualize the results as a bar chart

The housing Unit keep increasing over a period of time. If you see the trend, every year it keeps increasing

2.	Calculate and Plot the Average Sale Prices per Square Foot
use numerical and visual aggregation to calculate the average prices per square foot, and then visualize the results as a bar chart.

Yes, there was a drop in 2011 the sale price per square foot compared to the previous year(2010). 

2010 -- sale_price_sqr_foot -- 369.344353

2011 -- sale_price_sqr_foot -- 341.903429

In 2011 the sale_price_sqr_foot dropped by 27.440924

3.	Compare the Average Sale Prices by Neighborhood
 use interactive visualizations and widgets to explore the average sale price per square foot by neighborhood. 

4.	Build an Interactive Neighborhood Map
By using the geospatial relationships in the data by using interactive visualizations with hvPlot and GeoViews. To build your map, I used the `sfo_data_df` DataFrame (created during the initial import), which includes the neighborhood location data with the average prices.
